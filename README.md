This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Flower Clicky Game

* The app renders different images to the screen. 
* Each image will listen for click events.
* The app will keep track of the user's score. 
* The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. 
* The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.
